# Price Display Fix - Summary

## Problem Description
The crypto dashboard was occasionally displaying incorrect prices when users selected a cryptocurrency. The price would sometimes show outdated data, and multiple refreshes were needed to see the correct current price.

## Root Causes Identified

### 1. **Cache Issues**
- No cache-busting headers were set on API requests
- Browser and Cloudflare edge caching were storing stale responses
- When switching coins, cached data from previous selections could be returned

### 2. **Race Conditions**
- When changing coins, old data wasn't cleared before new data loaded
- Parallel API calls (`Promise.all`) could result in partial state updates with mixed old/new data
- The store state could briefly show data from the previously selected coin

### 3. **Data Source Confusion**
- The chart component was displaying "Latest Price" from the historical data endpoint (`/history`)
- The price card displayed current price from the live price endpoint (`/price`)
- These two endpoints could return different values due to:
  - Different timestamps
  - Different CoinGecko API endpoints with different caching
  - The historical data's last point being minutes old

## Fixes Implemented

### 1. **Cache-Busting Headers (stores.js)**
Added cache control headers and timestamp query parameters to all API requests:

```javascript
// Before
const response = await fetch(`${WORKER_URL}/price?coin=${coinId}`);

// After
const response = await fetch(`${WORKER_URL}/price?coin=${coinId}&_=${Date.now()}`, {
    headers: {
        'Cache-Control': 'no-cache, no-store, must-revalidate',
        'Pragma': 'no-cache'
    }
});
```

Applied to:
- `fetchPrice()`
- `fetchHistory()`
- `fetchNews()`

### 2. **State Clearing Before Data Load (stores.js)**
Modified `setCoin()` function to clear old data immediately when changing coins:

```javascript
export const setCoin = async (coinId) => {
    // Clear old data immediately to prevent showing stale data
    update(state => ({ 
        ...state, 
        loading: true, 
        error: null, 
        selectedCoin: coinId,
        priceData: null,      // ← Clear old price
        historyData: null,    // ← Clear old history
        newsData: null        // ← Clear old news
    }));
    
    try {
        // Fetch new data...
    } catch (error) {
        // Better error handling...
    }
}
```

### 3. **Worker Cache Headers (worker/index.js)**
Updated Cloudflare Worker to send no-cache headers in all responses:

```javascript
const CORS_HEADERS = {
  // ... existing headers
  'Cache-Control': 'no-cache, no-store, must-revalidate, max-age=0',
  'Pragma': 'no-cache',
  'Expires': '0'
};
```

### 4. **Removed Confusing Price Display (ChartCard.svelte)**
Changed the chart footer to show price range instead of "Latest Price":

```javascript
// Before: Showed last historical price (could be stale)
<span class="stat-label">Latest Price:</span>
<span class="stat-value">${historyData[historyData.length - 1].y}...</span>

// After: Shows price range over 7 days
<span class="stat-label">Price Range:</span>
<span class="stat-value">${min} - ${max}</span>
```

### 5. **Better Loading States**
- Added loading indicators in PriceCard to prevent showing $0.00 during data fetch
- Added `isRefreshing` flag to coin change handler
- Improved error handling with try-catch blocks

## Testing Recommendations

### Manual Testing Steps:
1. **Test coin switching:**
   - Select Bitcoin → verify price shows correctly
   - Switch to Ethereum → verify old Bitcoin price doesn't flash
   - Switch back to Bitcoin → verify fresh data loads

2. **Test refresh functionality:**
   - Click Refresh button multiple times
   - Verify price updates and no stale data shows

3. **Test real-time mode:**
   - Enable real-time updates
   - Wait 5 minutes
   - Verify fresh data loads automatically

4. **Test cache busting:**
   - Open browser dev tools → Network tab
   - Select a coin and check API requests
   - Verify each request has unique timestamp parameter
   - Verify response headers include Cache-Control: no-cache

### Expected Results:
✅ Price always shows current value for selected coin
✅ No flickering or stale data when switching coins
✅ Loading states display during data fetch
✅ Each API request has unique timestamp (no cached responses)
✅ Price card and chart show consistent data

## Files Modified

1. **src/lib/stores.js** - Added cache-busting, state clearing, error handling
2. **worker/index.js** - Added no-cache headers to prevent Cloudflare edge caching
3. **src/lib/components/PriceCard.svelte** - Added better loading state
4. **src/lib/components/ChartCard.svelte** - Removed confusing "Latest Price" display
5. **src/routes/+page.svelte** - Added isRefreshing state to coin change handler

## Technical Details

### Cache-Control Headers Explained:
- `no-cache`: Must revalidate with server before using cached response
- `no-store`: Don't store response in cache at all
- `must-revalidate`: Must revalidate stale cached responses
- `max-age=0`: Consider cached responses stale immediately
- `Pragma: no-cache`: HTTP/1.0 backward compatibility
- `Expires: 0`: Additional cache prevention

### Timestamp Query Parameter:
Adding `&_=${Date.now()}` to URLs ensures each request is unique, preventing browser from serving cached responses even if cache headers fail.

## Deployment Notes

1. **Build the project:**
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

2. **Deploy worker (if changed):**
   ```bash
   wrangler deploy
   ```

3. **Deploy to GitHub Pages:**
   - Push changes to repository
   - GitHub Actions will automatically build and deploy

## Monitoring

After deployment, monitor for:
- Correct price display across all coins
- No console errors about stale data
- Network requests showing unique timestamps
- Response headers containing no-cache directives

## Rollback Plan

If issues occur:
1. Revert changes to `src/lib/stores.js`
2. Rebuild and redeploy
3. Worker changes can be reverted via Wrangler rollback command
