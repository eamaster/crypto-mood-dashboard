# GitHub Pages Configuration Fix

## 🔴 Problem
When visiting https://hesam.me/crypto-mood-dashboard/, it shows the README.md file instead of the actual dashboard application.

## 🎯 Root Cause
GitHub Pages is not configured to use GitHub Actions as the deployment source. It's likely serving from the repository root or a gh-pages branch instead of the Actions-built artifacts.

## ✅ Solution - Configure GitHub Pages

### Step 1: Check Current Settings

1. Go to your repository: **https://github.com/eamaster/crypto-mood-dashboard**
2. Click **Settings** (top right)
3. In the left sidebar, click **Pages**

### Step 2: Update GitHub Pages Source

You should see **"Build and deployment"** section:

**Configure it to:**
- **Source:** Select **"GitHub Actions"** from the dropdown
- **NOT** "Deploy from a branch"

It should look like this:
```
Build and deployment
Source: GitHub Actions ✅
```

### Step 3: Verify Actions Permissions

While in Settings:
1. Click **Actions** → **General** in left sidebar
2. Scroll to **"Workflow permissions"**
3. Ensure **"Read and write permissions"** is selected
4. Ensure **"Allow GitHub Actions to create and approve pull requests"** is checked

### Step 4: Trigger a New Deployment

```bash
cd C:\Users\EAMASTER\crypto-mood-dashboard
git commit --allow-empty -m "Trigger GitHub Pages deployment"
git push origin main
```

### Step 5: Monitor Deployment

1. Visit: https://github.com/eamaster/crypto-mood-dashboard/actions
2. Wait for workflow to complete (green checkmark) ✅
3. Check the Pages deployment in Actions

### Step 6: Verify

After deployment completes:
1. Visit: https://hesam.me/crypto-mood-dashboard/
2. Should show the **dashboard** (not README) ✅
3. Should see price cards, charts, etc.

## 📋 Alternative: Manual Check

### If the above doesn't work, check these:

1. **Custom Domain Settings:**
   - In Settings → Pages
   - Check if custom domain `hesam.me` is configured
   - Should have subdirectory: `/crypto-mood-dashboard`

2. **Branch Settings:**
   - If using "Deploy from a branch":
     - Branch should be: `gh-pages` or `main`
     - Folder should be: `/ (root)` if using gh-pages, or `/build` if using main
   - **Recommended:** Use "GitHub Actions" instead

3. **CNAME File:**
   - Check if there's a CNAME file in repository
   - It should NOT exist for GitHub Pages with subdirectory

## 🔧 Quick Fix Commands

### Option 1: Add .nojekyll to root and redeploy
```bash
# Already done - .nojekyll created in repository root
git add .nojekyll
git commit -m "Add .nojekyll to prevent Jekyll processing"
git push origin main
```

### Option 2: Verify build output
```bash
# Check index.html exists
ls build/index.html

# Check if it's valid HTML (should show <!DOCTYPE html>)
cat build/index.html | Select-String "DOCTYPE"
```

## 🎯 Expected GitHub Pages Settings

**Correct Configuration:**
```
Settings → Pages
├─ Source: GitHub Actions ✅
├─ Custom domain: hesam.me ✅
└─ Enforce HTTPS: ✅ (checked)
```

**What GitHub Actions Does:**
1. Checks out code from main branch
2. Runs `npm ci` to install dependencies
3. Runs `npm run build` to create build folder
4. Uploads build folder as Pages artifact
5. Deploys artifact to GitHub Pages
6. Makes it available at: https://hesam.me/crypto-mood-dashboard/

## 🚨 Common Issues

### Issue: Shows README Instead of Dashboard
**Cause:** GitHub Pages source is not set to "GitHub Actions"
**Fix:** Settings → Pages → Source → Select "GitHub Actions"

### Issue: 404 on All Pages
**Cause:** Missing .nojekyll file
**Fix:** Already added to repository root

### Issue: Assets Not Loading
**Cause:** Base path not configured
**Fix:** Already configured in svelte.config.js (base: '/crypto-mood-dashboard')
