# üìä Crypto Mood Dashboard

The Crypto Mood Dashboard is a web application that provides real-time price, news, and sentiment analysis for various cryptocurrencies. It is built with SvelteKit and uses a Cloudflare Worker to fetch data from various third-party APIs. The dashboard displays the current price, 24-hour change, and a 7-day price history chart for the selected cryptocurrency. It also fetches the latest news headlines and uses Cohere to perform sentiment analysis on them, providing a "market mood" score.
